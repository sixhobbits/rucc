				<h2>About the Club</h2>

				<p>The Rhodes University Chess Club meets on Monday and Wednesday evenings from 19h00 to 21h00 at the King's Field Club House. Chess Boards, Clocks, Books, Tea, Coffee, and Hot Chocolate accompany chess players from many different levels of enthusiasm and skill, from those who play 'just for fun' to avid tournament players with ELO ratings of 1800+, for entertaining and competitive practice sessions.</p>

				<p>Our coach, Andrew Martin, is available on most evenings to give help and advice, or just for that experience of playing against a strong opponent.</p>

				<p>We attend open tournaments in Port Elizabeth and East London, host the annual Rhodes Closed and Rhodes Open, and participate in the Inter-varsity and USSA events.</p>

				<p>The Club also participates in various community engagement projects, notably coaching of scholars at Victoria Girls' High School and coaching of the Blind at Gadra. </p>

				<p>The end of year USSA tournament is a great event. Up to ten guys and five ladies attend this week-long tournament, usually held in the first week of December. In 2013, USSA will be hosted in Pretoria. The Club sponsors full board and lodging for the first team, and although the chess is pretty intense and competitive, great fun is always had. We encourage competition within the Club throughout the year and select the USSA team based not only on players' tournament experience and playing strength, but also on their participation and enthusiasm throughout the year -- so even if you believe you are a weak player, do not give up on becoming part of the team! You can read a summary of the 2012 event (hosted by NMMU) <a href="./tournaments.html#ussa2012">here</a>.</p>

				<p>We hope to see you at the club house!</p>

					<p class="date">USSA 2012</p>
					<p> <img src="images/ussa2012.jpg" width="130" height="119" alt="" />USSA 2012 was hosted by NMMU. We unfortunately had a lot of last minute drop-outs from our team, due to family crises and health issues, but the small dedicated group of five players who played in the tournament had a great time, and kept Rhodes on the chess map. This was a five day tournament, and we played 9 games, with two games per day, and one on the Wednesday. On Wednesday evening there was also a blitz tournament, which was great fun. The players who went up were:<br>

					Gareth Dwyer<br>
					Xolani Mpolongwana<br>
					Langelihle Ngwenya<br>
					Sebenzile Sopazi<br>
					Kudatinashe Makura<br>
					<br>
					And the results (out of 184 players and 9 games):<br>
